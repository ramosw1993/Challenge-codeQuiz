## Challenge-codeQuiz

# Description: For this coding challenge you will see that I am struggling with Javascript and Web API's, although resources are plentyfull it is difficult to discern from this information overload. I have done my best to bring you a game that is easy on the eyes and easy to play. However, I failed on the easy to play portion as the game is not yet functional but as you will see, the question is posted, the clock does start when you click play game, and the view score score section has its own page which you can click on from the top left corner. Some things I have learned are; that I get over whelmed from coding entire projects and that this is definitely a journey for me but one that I will come out a better problem solver and critical thinker.
